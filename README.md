Plugin for monitoring the ActiveMQ 
==============================================

This plugin monitors the performance metrics of your Apache ActiveMQ instances and destinations used and their activity along with connections and subscriptions.

### Prerequisites

- Download and install the latest version of the [Site24x7 Linux agent] / [Site24x7 Windows agent] (https://www.site24x7.com/app/client#/admin/inventory/add-monitor) in the server where you plan to run the plugin. 

- Plugin Uses "jmxquery" python library. This module is used to execute the jmx query and get data. Execute the below command to install python jmxquery modeule in your server.  

		pip install jmxquery
		
- JMX connection should be enabled in the Apache ActiveMQ installation folder. To enable the JMX connection follow the below steps: Open conf/activemq.xml inside the installation folder of Apache ActiveMQ and change the following attributes

		<managementContext>
    		     <managementContext createConnector="true" connectorPort="1099"/>
		</managementContext>


### Plugin installation
---
##### Linux 

- Create a directory "activemq" under Site24x7 Linux Agent plugin directory : 

      Linux (Root)      ->   /opt/site24x7/monagent/plugins/activemq
      Linux (Non Root)  ->   /home/<user_name>/site24x7/monagent/plugins/activemq

##### Windows 

- Create a directory "Site24x7_ActiveMQ" under Site24x7 Windows Agent plugin directory : 

      Windows           ->   C:\Program Files (x86)\Site24x7\WinAgent\monitoring\Plugins\activemq
      
---

- Download all the files in "activemq" folder and place it under the "activemq" directory

	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrkksparrow/Site24x7_ActiveMQ/main/activemq.py
	  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrkksparrow/Site24x7_ActiveMQ/main/acticemq.cfg
	
- Configure the keys to be monitored, as mentioned in the configuration section below.

- Execute the below command with appropriate arguments to check for the valid json output.  

		python activemq.py –-host_name=localhost -–port=1099 -–broker_name=<your_broker_name> --destination_name=<your_destination_name>


The agent will automatically execute the plugin within five minutes and send performance data to the Site24x7 data center.

### Configurations
---
	[display_name]
	host_name = “<your_host_name>”
	port = “1099”
	broker_name = “<your_broker_name>”
	destination_name = “<your_destination_name>”
